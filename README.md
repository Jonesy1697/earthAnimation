# earthAnimation
This project contains the final source code for the first task of Advanced Graphics and Vision which includes the creation of an orbiting satellite, rotation earth and user input. Source code is downloadable and should be edited and executed as specified with the following instructions.

## Getting Started
Before editing any of the following code, ensure that all code has been downloaded, as the main script will reference other scripts in the directory. 

### Prerequisites
Before editing/executing the source code, ensure that there is a web browser implemented on the system, such as Internet Explorer, Mircrosoft Edge or Firefox. **Take note** - When using recourses, Google Chrom will not render these onto an object.

To edit code, ensure that a text editor has been installed to the computer, such as Notepad++.

For user input, ensure that a keyboard and mouse are both connected to the computer, and a monitor is available to display the website.

### Installing
Once the source code has been downloaded, ensure that all files are kept in the same format and directories as specified, as code will call these specific commands during execution. If any file is renamed or moved, ensure that the call directory is changed within the course code. 

The directory can be hosted privately on a local machine, or on a public server, which will require further setup of the machine. This project has been inplemented in a local environement.

## Editing and testing
All source code is editable in an appropriate text editor. If hosting on a public server, ensure that code is replaced on the server directory when finished editing.

## Built with
 * [Notepad++] (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Text editing software
 * [FireFox] (https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) - Web browsing software
